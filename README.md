Build a simple UI that looks something like this. Feel free to have some design liberty. We'd like to see you build this as a React application with Redux to manage the state being passed around the components. To give you a summary of the what the mini application does

- Read json file as mock API responses (Attached).
- Have tabs for each sport, NBA, NHL and NFL (think about how we can make it so that adding more sports is easy)
- Build a component that lets you search through the teams
- When you find a team you should be able to hit the star icon on the right and it will favorite the team for you
- For the purpose of this exercise you can store the users favorite teams in localstorage
- If the user refreshes the page, the teams are read from localstorage and displayed like below with a highlight indicating they are your favorite teams.
